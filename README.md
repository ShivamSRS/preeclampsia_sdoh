# Preeclampsia SDOH Aware Risk Mitigation Framework

Welcome to the Preeclampsia SDOH Aware Risk Mitigation Framework GitHub repository. This framework aims to address the higher risk of readmission for women from underprivileged backgrounds after preeclampsia by leveraging social determinants of health (SDOH) and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques.

This repository uses SDOH from AHRQ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w77DuqxayI6oLQMZQguDc4spm0rfrV-n/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106526722448375984296&rtpof=true&sd=true and Internal deidentified UC-D health data to generate a model that gives patients risks scores for readmission. 


## Overview

This project introduces a novel approach to mitigating the risk of readmission due to preeclampsia by focusing on SDOH factors. Utilizing zipcode-based datasets, our ML risk detection and generative AI solutions aim to identify risks and provide equitable access to care, preventing unnecessary readmissions.

## Key Features

- **SDOH Integration:** Utilizes zipcode-based SDOH datasets to identify at-risk individuals, ensuring interventions are tailored to the unique needs of underprivileged communities.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Develops and implements a sophisticated ML pipeline for accurate risk prediction of preeclampsia readmission.
- **County-Wise Risk Scores:** Facilitates policy making and resource allocation through county-wise risk score analysis, with ongoing efforts in the Sacramento area of California.
- **Automated Patient Support:** Implements a RAG (Red, Amber, Green) based automated query and retrieval pipeline, alongside a Gen-AI chatbot for personalized patient care.
- **Educational Tools:** Develops Gen-AI powered multilingual video tutorials to mitigate education and language barriers related to SDOH.

## Phases and Progress

1. **Data Procurement:** Collection of large-scale preeclampsia data and alignment with SDOH datasets.
2. **ML Pipeline Development:** Complete development of the ML pipeline for risk prediction.
3. **Policy Support:** Implementation of county-wise risk scores for resource allocation (20% complete for California's Sacramento area).
4. **Patient-Centric Support:** Development of automated patient support pipelines and educational tools with progress in Gen-AI chatbot (40% complete) and tutorial generator (20% complete).
